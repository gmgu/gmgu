### Research Interests
My primary research efforts have been devoted to developing fast algorithms. I have developed fast algorithms for graph isomorphim, graph isomorphism query processing, and multiple pattern Cartesian tree matching during my Ph.D. study. At LG Electronics, I have developed AI coding assistant using large language model (LLM).

### Work Experience
**LG Electronics - Artificial Intelligence Lab (Senior Researcher)**
- Aug. 2022 – Present: Fine-tuning large language models (of size over 15 billion) for AI coding assistance using PyTorch FSDP and DeepSpeed (for full parameter fine-tuning), and LoRA (for parameter-efficient fine-tuning) on AWS SageMaker. Development of data augmentation techniques for causal language models. Inference server development for large language model using NVIDIA Triton, FastTransformer, and FastAPI. Inference optimization for transformer models using flash attention and paged attention.
- Apr. 2022 – Dec. 2022: Training a small language model (from scratch) for AI coding assistance using PyTorch. Web UI development using Python Streamlit. Inference server development for language models using Flask and ShannonAI/service-streamer.

**Seoul National University – Institute of Computer Technology (Post-Doctoral Assistant)**
- Jan. 2022 – Mar. 2022: Algorithm development for graph isomorphism query processing (Efficient Graph Isomorphism Query Processing using Degree Sequences and Color-Label Distributions, IEEE ICDE 2022).
